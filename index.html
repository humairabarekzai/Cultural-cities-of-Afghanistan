        <h1 class="subtitle">Afghanistan </h1>
        <p>Afghanistan is a land of deep history and rich cultural layers, shaped by its <mark>position at the crossroads of Central and South Asia.</mark> <br>For thousands of years, traders, poets, scholars, and travelers passed through its mountains and valleys, leaving behind a blend of traditions, languages, and beliefs.<br> Afghan culture is strongly rooted in hospitality, storytelling, music, and poetry, with values passed down through generations despite decades of change and hardship. <br>From ancient Buddhist heritage to Islamic art and architecture, Afghanistan’s cultural identity reflects resilience and pride in its past.<br>

Afghan cities each carry unique cultural stories of their own. Kabul, the capital, has long been a center of learning and art, known for its poetry circles and historic gardens.<br> Herat is famous for its stunning architecture, calligraphy, and role as a cultural heart of the Timurid Empire. Mazar-e-Sharif is known for<br> the Blue Mosque and vibrant Nowruz celebrations, while Kandahar is deeply connected to Pashtun traditions and the origins of modern Afghanistan. <br>Together, these cities tell the story of a country where history, culture, and identity are closely woven into everyday life.
